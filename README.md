## Sample Solutions to 2014 Problems

### Novice
Some questions look deceptively easy, but are actually not so easy to get right in the first try. Some questions look
hard at first glance, but in almost all cases, there is an easier way if the question is framed properly.

In terms of programming construct, it will help if one is familiar with java.util package. Collections.sort, Arrays.toString,
and Arrays.asList often come handy for productivity. The novice level problems may not be tricky or convoluted, but they
all require basic input and output processing, and good coding fundamentals.

1. (B) PrimeEvil
1. (C) Ampersand

### Advanced
The first 8 problems are actually reused from the Novice questions. For the rest 4 problems, knowledge of common
(and sometimes not-so-common) algorithms is helpful. The idea is to apply algorithms instead of brute-force approach.
